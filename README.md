Brief description:

The Download Game of Thrones Character data contains network data for character relationships within George R. R. Martin’s A Storm of Swords, the third novel in his series A Song of Ice and Fire (also known as the HBO television adaptation Game of Thrones). This data was originally compiled by A. Beveridge and J. Shan for their article, “Network of Thrones”.

The nodes csv contains 107 different characters, and the edges csv contains 353 weighted relationships between those characters, which were calculated based on how many times two characters’ names appeared within 15 words of one another in the novel. For more on the methodology, see Beveridge and Shan’s original article.
